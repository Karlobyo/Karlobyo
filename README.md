### Hey hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist originally from Venice (IT), but Berliner since 2013.

I have many new project ideas and will develop them in the soon future (extremely happy if you'd like to contribute/collaborate!)...stay tuned!

So...we're in business!

Can't wait to explore new ways and meet amazing people along the road!

Bless
