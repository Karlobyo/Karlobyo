### Hey hey! ðŸ‘‹

I come from Venice, Italy, but I was adopted by Berlin already in 2013 and since then my heart is splitted between these 2 very different but equally wonderful places... ðŸ’š

I have been involved in molecular medicine and pharmacology research for many years but lately I am deep diving more and more into data science and I am extremely excited to explore further this direction and investigate the potential of coding in solving the big and small challenges of our times

I love coding and I am totally fascinated by deep learning neural networks

Another big passion of mine is music and in my project "Composer Electronifire" I am trying to fuse music and AI to unite past and future...

I have many new project ideas and I will develop them in the immediate future (I would be extremely happy if you'd like to contribute/collaborate!)...stay tuned! ðŸ’š

So...we're in business!

Can't wait to explore new ways and meet amazing peeps along the road!

Bless
