### Hey hey! ðŸ‘‹

I come from Venice, Italy, but I moved to Berlin already in 2013 and since then my heart is splitted between these 2 very different but equally wonderful places... ðŸ’š

I have been involved in molecular medicine and pharmacology research for many years and recently I am deep diving more and more into data science and biomedical AI! 

I have many new project ideas and will develop them in the soon future (extremely happy if you'd like to contribute/collaborate!)...stay tuned! 

So...we're in business!

Can't wait to explore new ways and meet amazing people along the road!

Bless
